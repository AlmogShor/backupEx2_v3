## Introduction
This is our third project in the OOP course.
In this project we worked with threads.


## Threed
Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

## ThreedPool
Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reused many times.
In the case of a thread pool, a group of fixed-size threads is created. 
A thread from the thread pool is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. 
After completion of the job, the thread is contained in the thread pool again.

# Part 1
In this part we tested efficiency between different forms of using threads.
We ceated several text files and calculated the total number of lines in these files.
We did it by using three methods:
- [x] Normal method without using threads.
- [x] With using threads.
- [x] With using threadPool.

This is the performance in milliseconds for the three methods
| Normal  | Thread | ThreadPool  | 
| ------  | ------ | ---------   |
|  7 ms   |  37 ms |   3 ms      | 


## Main Classes
- [x] **Ex2_1** 
    - **createTextFiles** - creating number of files (with given number). 
    - **getNumOfLines** - counting lines in natural way with BufferedReader.  
    - **getNumOfLinesThreads** - counting lines using threads. 
    - **getNumOfLinesThreadPool** - counting lines using thread pool.
- [x] **runnableFilesReader**

# Part 2
## BackGround
> PRIORITY-BASED TASK SCHEDULING
>>The Java Virtual machine (JVM) schedules threads using a preemptive, priority-based policy.
Every thread has a priority - Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with
lower priority. When code running in a thread creates a new Thread object, the new thread has its
initial priority set automatically equal to the priority of the creating thread.
If a thread was created using a different ThreadGroup, the priority of the newly created thread is the
smaller of priority of the thread creating it and the maximum permitted priority of the thread group.
If a thread with a higher priority than the currently running thread enters the RUNNABLE state, the
scheduler preempts the executing thread schedules the thread with the higher priority to run.
The Scheduler may also invoke a different thread to run if the currently running thread changes state
from RUNNABLE to a different state such as BLOCKED, WAITING or TERMINATED.
A user may set the priority of a thread using the method: public final void setPriority(int newPriority).
The setPriority method changes the priority of a thread. For platform threads, the priority is set to the
smaller of the specified newPriority and the maximum permitted priority of the thread group.
If a thread with a higher priority than the currently running thread enters the RUNNABLE state, the
scheduler preempts the executing thread schedules the thread with the higher priority to run.
The Scheduler may also invoke a different thread to run if the currently running thread changes state
from RUNNABLE to a different state such as BLOCKED, WAITING or TERMINATED.
A user may set the priority of a thread using the method: public final void setPriority(int newPriority).
The setPriority method changes the priority of a thread. For platform threads, the priority is set to the
smaller of the specified newPriority and the maximum permitted priority of the thread group.

>BUILT-IN LIMITATIONS
>>Java enables developers to set the priority of a thread, but not the Runnable operation it executes.
Tightly coupling the operation with the execution path that runs it creates major drawback when
using an executor such as a ThreadPoolExecutor: the collection of threads in an executor is defined by
a ThreadFactory. By default, it creates all threads with the same priority and non-daemon status.
Moreover, if we wish to execute a returning value operation, for example using the Callable<V>
interface, there are no constructors in the Thread class that get a Callable<V> as parameter and we
ought to use an Executor of some type, such as a ThreadPoolExecutor.



## The mission
In this part we were asked to create two new types that extend the functionality of Java's Concurrency Framework:
1. A generic task with a Type that returns a result and may throw an exception.
Each task has a priority used for scheduling, inferred from the integer value of the task's Type.
2. A custom thread pool class that defines a method for submitting a generic task as described in
the section 1 to a priority queue, and a method for submitting a generic task created by a
Callable<V> and a Type, passed as arguments.



## Main Classes
- [x] **Task** 
 > Represents a task with a TaskType and may return a value of some type 
    - **Task** -  takes the callable task, convert it to Future task and execute it to the thread pool.
    - **createTask** - Factory method - Published method to create a task for safe creation.
    - **createTask** - Published task creation in case the type is other - not defined.
    - **equals** - Compares between two tasks.
    - **hashCode** - Hash performance of task.
   
- [x] **CustomExecutor**
  > An Executor that asynchronously computes Task instances. 
    - **submit** -  takes the callable task, convert it to Future task and execute it to the thread pool.
    - **submit** - without type definition.
    - **submit** - methods to register  observers.
    - **gracefullyTerminate** - methods to unregister observers.
    - **Insert** - Inserts the string into this character sequence.
    - **Append** - Appends the specified string to this character sequence.
    - **Delete** - Removes the characters in a substring of this sequence.
    - **Undo** - Erases the last change done to the document, reverting it to an older state.
